# Introduction

A company that designs fonts wants to improve their website.
They'd like to automatically show a random sentence when someone is looking at a font.
To give a sense of what the font looks like, the random sentences should use all the letters in the English alphabet.

They're running a competition to get suggestions for sentences that they can use.
Your friend is in charge of checking the submissions to see if they are valid.

The competition went viral on social media, and your friend needs to check thousands of sentences.

They've asked you to help out.
