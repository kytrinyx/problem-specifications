# Introduction

You have stumbled upon a group of mathematicians who are also singer-songwriters.

They have written songs for all their favorite numbers, and, as you can imagine, they have a lot of favorite numbers.

You are curious to hear one of their songs, but with so many numbers to choose from, finding the right song could take a while.

Fortunately, they have organized their songs in a playlist sorted by the title—which is simply the number that the song is about.

You realize that you can use a binary search algorithm to quickly find a song given the title.
