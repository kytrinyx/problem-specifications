# Introduction

You are starting a secret coding club with some friends and friends-of-friends.
You don't know everyone in the club, so you and your friends have decided to create a secret handshake that you can use to recognise that someone is a member.
You don't want anyone who isn't in the know to be able to crack the code.

You designed the code so that one person says a number between 1 and 30, and the other other person turns it into a series of actions.
