# Introduction

There's a joke that goes:

_There are 10 types of people in the world._
_There are those who understand binary, and those who don't._

You belong to the group that understands binary, and you and your binary-savvy friends want to create a secret handshake.
You don't want anyone who isn't in the know to be able to crack the code.

So you come up with a sequence of actions, where each action corresponds to a different binary digit.
