# Introduction

You are making a secret coding club with some friends and friends-of-friends. 
You don't know everyone in the club, so you and your friends have decided to create a secret handshake that you can use to recognise that someone is a member.
You don't want anyone who isn't in the know to be able to crack the code.

You and your friends have decided to come up with a code that use binary (because you're a geek and think binary is cool) and turns it into a series of actions that you do during the handshake.
