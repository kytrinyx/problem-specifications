# Instructions

Your task is to write a prototype for managing train routes.

You don't need to worry about arrival and departure times at the stations for the prototype.
Each station will simply be represented by a number.

Routes can be extended, adding stations to the beginning or end of a route.
They can also be shortened by removing stations from the beginning or the end of a route.

Sometimes a station gets closed down, and in that case the program will need to be able to remove the station from the route, even if it is not at the beginning or end of the route.

The size of a route is measured not by how far the train travels, but by how many stations it stops at.
