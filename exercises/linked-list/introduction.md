# Introduction

You are working on a project to develop a train scheduling system for a busy railway network.

Your team has decided to use a doubly linked list to represent each train route in the schedule.
Each station along the train's route will be represented by a node in the linked list.

```exercism/note
The linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science, often used in the implementation of other data structures.
It is a list of "nodes" that links to its neighbors.
In a **singly linked list** each node links only to the node that follows it.
In a **doubly linked list** each node links to both the node that comes before, as well as the node that comes after.

If you want to dig deeper into linked lists, check out [this article][intro-linked-list] that explains it using nice drawings.
