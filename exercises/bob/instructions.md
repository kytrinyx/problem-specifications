# Instructions

Your task is to determine what Bob will reply to someone when they say something to him or ask him a question.

Bob only ever answers one of five things:

- **"Sure."**
  This is his response if you ask him a question, such as "How are you?"
- **"Whoa, chill out!"**
  This is his answer if you YELL AT HIM (in all capitals).
- **"Calm down, I know what I'm doing!"**
  This is what he says if you yell a question at him.
- **"Fine. Be that way!"**
  This is how he responds if you address him without actually saying anything.
- **"Whatever."**
  This is what he answers to anything else.

For the purpose of this exercise, you can assume that Bob's conversational partner always follows normal rules regarding sentence punctuation in English.
