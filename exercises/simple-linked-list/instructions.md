# Instructions

Your task is to create a prototype for a playlist feature for a music player application.

The feature will need to be able to import and export playlists.

For the prototype, each song will simply be represented by a number.
The import/export functionality will use arrays.

Given a range of numbers (the song IDs), create a linked list.

Given a singly linked list, you should be able to
- reverse the list
- convert the list to an array

Given an array, you should be able to convert it to a singly linked list.
