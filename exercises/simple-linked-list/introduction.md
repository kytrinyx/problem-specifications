# Introduction

You are a software developer at a music streaming company, and you've been tasked with creating a playlist feature for your music player application.

You decide to make a simple prototype that uses a singly-linked list to create a playlist that users can listen to as is, or in reverse order.

For now you're just working on getting the basic functionality right, so this version won't work with realistic data.

```exercism/note
The linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science, often used in the implementation of other data structures.

The simplest kind of linked list is a **singly** linked list.
That means that each element (or "node") contains data, along with something that points to the next node in the list.

If you want to dig deeper into linked lists, check out [this article][intro-linked-list] that explains it using nice drawings.
