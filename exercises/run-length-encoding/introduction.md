# Introduction

You run knitting retreats.
Knitting enthusiasts get together in remote cabins all over the world for four days of knitting and socializing.

You found a giant warehouse full of old USB storage keys.
They're pretty small in modern termsâ€”they won't hold all that much data.
But they're perfect as a small gift for the participants of your knitting retreats.

You want to store traditional knitting patterns from all over the world.
In order to store as many patterns as possible, you will need to encode the patterns.
