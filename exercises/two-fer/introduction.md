# Introduction

In some dialects of English, when you say "two for" quickly or in casual conversation, it sounds like "two fer".
Two-for-one is a way of saying that if you buy one, you also get one for free.

Imagine a bakery that has a Valentine's Day offer where you can buy two cookies for the price of one ("two-fer one!").
You've gone for the offer and (very generously) decided to share the extra cookie with a friend.
