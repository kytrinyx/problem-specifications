# Introduction

`Two-fer` or `2-fer` is short for _two for one_.

The name `two-fer` is used in some English-speaking countries when providing an offer or discount.
It comes from the pronunciation of "two for".
In some dialects of English, when you say "two for" quickly or in casual conversation, it sounds like "two fer".

Imagine a food store that has a Valentine's discount where you can buy two cookies for the price of one ("two-fer one!"). You've gone for the offer and (very generously) decided to share the extra cookie with a friend!
